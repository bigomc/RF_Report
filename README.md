# RF_Report

**The report file is report.pdf**

The report consists of the latex files to generate the report and two folders,
one (images) contains the images used in the latex report and the other (code)
contains the code in matlab for the simulations.

The __code__ folder contains another three folders for every part of the report
respectively.

- Part1:    For this part of the report the main file is **trajectories_script**
            which runs the trajectories and comprises. File **workspace_script**
            is the file script that computes the workspace of the robot and all 
            other files are functions created and used by those two scripts.
- Part2:    Part 2 has two separete scripts to run the simulations for inverse
            kinematics and other for the workspace.
- Part3:    This part contains three matlab files, the script **iterative_ik**
            is Rodrigo's inverse jacobian iterative method whilst the other two
            files belogs to Mang.
